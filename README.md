# Go Microservices Playground

A learning playground to understand microservices fundamentals using Go and gRPC.

## Services
- user-service: owns user data and exposes gRPC APIs
- order-service: consumes user-service via gRPC

## Goals
- Understand service-to-service communication
- Learn gRPC and Protobuf
- Practice Dockerized microservices
- Prepare for extracting services from a monolithic system
